This introductory-level tutorial on the basics of Python, was very similar to the other introductory course in Python by Mosh Hamedani. It revisited the basics â€“ variables, datatypes, type casting, controliterative statements, and arithmetic and logical operators. He did, however explain the concept behind methods in detail, which led me to understand the concept and need for methods better. I also learnt the usage of the range() function and the multiple ways in which it accepts parameters and parses through the numbers in the needed range.
