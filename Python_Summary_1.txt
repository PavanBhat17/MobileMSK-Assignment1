Mosh Hamedaniâ€™s comprehensive Python course taught me all the basics of Python. Datatypes, variables, strings, operations, iterative statements, conditional statements, lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, functions, etc. Following along with him to recreate the three projects strengthened my understanding of file handling using python, using Jupyter notebook, and using the Django framework. The first project taught me how to automate otherwise tedious processes related to spreadsheets. The second project taught me how to use the pandas and sklearn libraries to build a basic ML model using Jupyter notebook. Through the third project, I learnt how to create a basic website using the Django framework.
