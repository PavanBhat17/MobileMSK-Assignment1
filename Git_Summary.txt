"Git Started with Github" by Jason Taylor offered on Udemy is a beginner-friendly introductory course on Git source control and Github hosting service. The course begins off with Jason explaining us why we need Git/Github and then teaches us how to install Git for Windows/MacOS/Linux. He then explains some terminologies in Git such as repository,etc. Jason then guides us in creating a simple demo repository to show basic Git workflow. Then, he teaches us how to use Git BASH to setup a project folder and configure our user name and email address. Subsequently, we are taught how to clone a repository and copy the cloned reporsitory from Github to our local computer. Jason then demonstrates how to commit a change and explains the differnt status in Git. Lastly, he teaches us to perform a "Push" and move files from our local directory to Github. Overall, it is a very helpful course for beginners to get introduced to version control and I learnt a lot from the course.
